# Introduction : 
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide secure authentication for client-server applications. The primary goal of Kerberos is to enable secure communication over a non-secure network, such as the Internet.

1.The user initiates a service request and forwards a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) request to the Kerberos Authentication Server (AS).

2.The AS validates the user's identity and responds by providing an encrypted TGT.

3.Upon decrypting the TGT, the user submits it to the Ticket-Granting Server (TGS) to obtain a service ticket.

4.The TGS authenticates the TGT and issues a service ticket in return.

5.With the received service ticket in hand, the user transmits it to the Service Server.

6.At this point, the client gains access to the requested service, leveraging the provided service ticket.
