#Introduction : 
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide secure authentication for client-server applications. It was developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1980s. The primary goal of Kerberos is to enable secure communication over a non-secure network, such as the Internet.
